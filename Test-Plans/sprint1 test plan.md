**1.0 Introduction**

Created a website that allows users to go to numerous sites, including the about us, API calling, and home pages. The website also has a signup page that allows users to establish an account and then successfully login to gain access to the website's dashboard.

**2.0 Test Items**

-   Sign-in page Requirement
-   Sign-up page Requiremnet
-   Database Requirement
-   Dashboard Page Requirement
-   Welcome Page Requirement
-   About Us Page Requirement 
-   Logout Page


**3.0 Features to be Tested**

On the Login page, double-check that all labels and controls, such as text fields, buttons, and links, are there. Check that the labels' font type and size, as well as the content placed on the various parts, are legible. Check that the size, color, and UI of the various elements are in accordance with the standards. Check that the app's user interface (UI) is responsive, meaning that it adjusts to multiple screen resolutions and devices.

**4.0 Approach**

The approach to test the features would be by inputting correct and
incorrect credentials in the signup and login page. To check the
database requirement, we’ll see if the data is getting parsed correctly
in our database and if our server is getting launched smoothly without
any “Server error”.

**5.0 Pass/Fail Criteria**

To check the pass/fail criteria, we’ll try different username and
password combinations for the signup and the login page. If the user is
able to successfully sign-up and login, then the test case passes, but
if the user is unable to sign-up or login, then the test case fails.
Similarly, for the database requirement, if the user credentials get
correctly parsed in our database, then it’s a pass otherwise it’s a
fail.
