1.  **Introduction**

    Created a website which enables a user to navigate to multiple pages
    like the about us page, API calling page and the home page. The
    website also comprises of a signup page which would allow the user
    to create an account and then successfully login in order to land on
    the website’s dashboard.

3.  **Features to be Tested**

-   Sign-up page Requirement

-   Sign-in page Requirement

-   Database Requirement
-   Dashboard Page

**4.0 Approach**

The approach to test the features would be by inputting correct and
incorrect credentials in the signup and login page. To check the
database requirement, we’ll see if the data is getting parsed correctly
in our database and if our server is getting launched smoothly without
any “Server error”.

**5.0 Pass/Fail Criteria**

To check the pass/fail criteria, we’ll try different username and
password combinations for the signup and the login page. If the user is
able to successfully sign-up and login, then the test case passes, but
if the user is unable to sign-up or login, then the test case fails.
Similarly, for the database requirement, if the user credentials get
correctly parsed in our database, then it’s a pass otherwise it’s a
fail.
